<body>
    <h1>How to get a good swing in</h1>
    <p>1: Stance: Begin with a shoulder-width stance, knees slightly bent, weight evenly distributed.</p>
    <p>2: Grip: Hold the bat firmly but not too tight, with your dominant hand at the bottom (closer to the knob).</p>
    <p>3: Ready Position: Keep the bat parallel to the ground at shoulder height, elbows relaxed and bent.</p>
    <p>4: Load: Shift weight back onto your back leg, raising the bat slightly behind your rear shoulder.</p>
    <p>5: Stride: Take a small, balanced step forward with your front foot.</p>
    <p>6: Rotation: Initiate hip and torso rotation toward the pitcher, transferring weight to your front foot.</p>
    <p>7: Hands to the Ball: Bring the bat through the hitting zone, aiming for middle contact.</p>
    <p>8: Contact: Keep eyes on the ball, making contact slightly in front of the plate with head down.</p>
    <p>9: Follow Through: Continue the swing motion fully, allowing the bat to extend and body to rotate.</p>
    <p>10: Finish: Complete the swing with balanced weight on your front foot and body in an athletic position.</p>
