    <h1>How to Throw the Perfect jab</h1>
    <p>
      1: Stance: stand up straight and place your feet shoulder-width apart. 
      Knees slightly bent and your non-dominant (lead) foot and hand forward. 
      Always jab with your lead hand. Shift one foot slightly ahead of the other 
      for an angled approach, while incorporating a slight twist to keep your hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      2: Throw the Jab: To throw a jab, step forward slightly with your lead foot, 
      driving force, and energy from the back foot. Your non-lead hand will stay in 
      a fist by your face to guard you, as your lead hand extends.

      When throwing a jab, make sure you fire your shoulder forward as you punch to 
      create a nice snap so that your shoulder touches your jaw. Doing so will ensure 
      you get maximum reach out of your jab and will also shield your chin with your shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      3: Rotation: As your fist extends, it should rotate so that your knuckles face the sky and 
      your palm faces the floor while the elbow straightens. Remember to keep your knees slightly 
      bent and light throughout the punch - resist the temptation to straighten your knees and pop 
      up when you throw your jab. If your knees are too straight, it throws off your balance and 
      reduces the control and power of your jab.
    </p>
    <p>
      4: The Return: As soon as your jab connects with its target(or even if you miss), pull your 
      jab hand back to your starting position. Do not hesitate the return as this will leave you open
      to a counter punch.
    </p>
